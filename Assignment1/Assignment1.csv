 "," Given the variance of g(θ) derived in part ii), modify the R code edward.odds.exe 
seen in Week 3 lectures to incorporate the calculation of the variance of  g(θ). Use this 
code to calculate the value, and its variance, of Yule’s Q, Yule’s Y, Digby’s H and

"3"," 2 – Common Odds Ratio’s for Stratified 2x2 Tables             (20 marks) 
Suppose we have G stratified 2x2 contingency tables where, for each contingency table, the 
odds ratio can be determined. However, a “common odds ratio” can also be derived for all G 
tables.  
 "," The two most popular “common odds ratio’s” are the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) estimate 
(Mantel and Haenszel, 1959) and the Woolf estimator (Woolf, 1995). Define these odds 
ratio estimators and describe how they calculate the common odds ratio. (5 marks) 
 "," Cochran (1954) proposed a similar test statistic to Mantel and Haenszel (1959). As a 
result a third variation of the common odds ratio is known as the Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel (CMH) statistic. Define this statistic and state how it differs to what Mantel 
and Haenszel (1959) proposed.         (5 marks) 
 "," Consider Table 6.9 on page 226 of Agresti (2013). It consists of 8 2x2 contingency 
tables that examine the success or failure of a drug (and a placebo) in a clinical trial 
across 8 centres. For this data calculate the odds ratio for each of the centres, and 
determine the MH, Woolfe and CMH statistic. Where zero cell frequencies are present 
describe how you dealt with those.      (10 marks)

"4"," 3 – The Divergence Statistic                (30 marks) 
Suppose we consider the following two-way contingency table which was originally seen in 
Calimlin et. al (1982). The study was aimed at testing four analgesic drugs (randomly 
assigned the labels A, B, C and D) and their effect on 121 hospital patients. The patients were 
given a five point scale consisting of the categories Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good and 
Excellent on which to make their decision. The data is summarised below and should be 
entered into R as the object drug.dat. 
 
 
 "," Using chisq.test() in R, test the determine whether there is a statistically 
significant association between drug and their effectiveness. Ensure you specify the 
hypotheses, chi-squared statistic, degrees of freedom and p-value of your test. 
(5 marks) 
 "," Using R, compare the Monte-Carlo p-value’s when randomly generating 10, 100, 1000 
and 10000 contingency tables.         (6 marks) 
 "," Using R, write an R function divergCR.exe that calculates the chi-squared value 
and its Monte-Carlo p-value of each member of the Cressie-Read divergence statistic 
discussed in the lecture. Provide a figure showing the distribution of each statistic and 
comment on the relative accuracy of these statistics for drug.dat.  (12 marks) 
 "," Write an R function plotdivergCR.exe that plots the Cressie-Read divergence 
statistic versus [ ]1,1−∈λ  for drug.dat. From this plot, describe how the members of 
the divergence statistic (visually) compare and discuss the validity of specific values of 
λ for the contingency table.         (7 marks)

The following output seen in Week 2 lectures is based on the execution of the R function 
monte.study.exe to Galton’s fingerprint data and provides the Monte-Carlo p-value for 
each measure of association based on the simulation of 10000 contingency tables. Write R 
code that verifies these calculations for Galton’s fingerprint data. Provide a comparison of the 
indices and their distribution of the randomly generated values. Provide an argument that 
explains which of them provides a good indication of the association and those that don't.

When this is property not satisfied, variance stabilising strategies can be implemented.  One

categorical variables with v degrees of freedom, the chi-squared random variable, 2αχ , has a 
mean and variance ( ) vE 2 =χα  and ( ) v2Var 2 =χα  respectively.
